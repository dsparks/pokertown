          <h2>Poker Farm — Solo Variant</h2>
          <p>In <strong>Poker Farm</strong>, you plant your fields alone, building a 5×5 grid of cards by carefully drafting pairs from a rotating supply. Each card shapes multiple poker hands at once — rows, columns, and diagonals — and your challenge is to plant wisely, anticipating how each new card will strengthen or weaken your future harvest.</p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Shuffle a standard 52-card deck.</li>
            <li>Set aside two cards face up; these stay visible but unused.</li>
            <li>Leave space in front of you for your 5×5 grid and a face-up discard pile.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>The game proceeds over 25 placements, with each round following this pattern:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Reveal three cards face up from the deck.</li>
            <li>Discard a fourth card from the top of the deck, putting it face up into the discard pile.</li>
            <li>Choose two of the three revealed cards to place into your grid.</li>
            <li>Each drafted card must be placed immediately into your layout, adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one existing card. Cards cannot be moved later.</li>
            <li>Discard the unchosen card.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Continue this process until only two cards remain in the deck. Reveal both, choose one as your final (25th) placement, and discard the other. As you build your grid, your farm can expand in any way you choose, but you do need to end up with an exact 5×5 grid.</p>

          <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <p>When your farm is full, score each of your twelve poker lines: five rows, five columns, and two diagonals. Use the scoring table below to determine the value of each hand, then total your points to measure the bounty of your harvest.</p>
          <table>
            <tr><th>Points</th><th>Hand</th></tr>
            <tr><td>55</td><td>Royal Flush</td></tr>
            <tr><td>34</td><td>Straight Flush</td></tr>
            <tr><td>21</td><td>Four of a Kind</td></tr>
            <tr><td>13</td><td>Full House</td></tr>
            <tr><td>8</td><td>Flush</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>Straight</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>Three of a Kind</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>Two Pair</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>One Pair</td></tr>
            <tr><td>0</td><td>High Card</td></tr>
          </table>
          <p>The theoretical maximum score is 359 points — an unlikely but satisfying harvest. Note your score and try to beat it in future games.</p>

          <h2>Poker Town — Two Player Game</h2>
          <p><strong>Poker Town</strong> is a tactical game of drafting and intersecting poker hands for two players. Each player builds their own 5×5 “town” of crisscrossing poker streets, placing cards that contribute to several lines at once. When the final card is placed, players compare their completed towns head-to-head to determine who the best city planner is.</p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Shuffle a standard 52-card deck.</li>
            <li>Set aside two cards face up; these stay visible but unused.</li>
            <li>Randomly choose a first player.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>The game is played over 13 rounds. Each round consists of drafting and placement:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Deal four cards face up.</li>
            <li>Players draft in snake order: the first player takes one, the second takes two, and the first takes the last.</li>
            <li>Each drafted card must be placed immediately into your layout, adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one existing card. Cards cannot be moved later.</li>
            <li>After each round, switch who drafts first.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>After 13 rounds (the final round having only two cards drafted), both players will have completed 5×5 grids (25 cards each). As you build your grid, your town can expand in any way you choose, but you do need to end up with an exact 5×5 grid.</p>

          <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <p>Each player’s grid contains twelve poker lines — five rows, five columns, and two diagonals (NW↘SE and SW↗NE). Players compare lines/hands head to head, going west to east by column, north to south by row, and finishing with the two diagonals. For each corresponding line, compare hands using standard poker rankings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Royal Flush</li>
            <li>Straight Flush</li>
            <li>Four of a Kind</li>
            <li>Full House</li>
            <li>Flush</li>
            <li>Straight</li>
            <li>Three of a Kind</li>
            <li>Two Pair</li>
            <li>One Pair</li>
            <li>High Card</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The stronger hand earns one point for that line; ties score nothing. The player with the most points out of 12 wins. If still tied, the player with the single strongest hand anywhere in their grid wins.</p>

          <h2>Poker Park — Three Player Game</h2>
          <p><strong>Poker Park</strong> is a three-player variant where each player builds a lattice of intersecting paths — two rows and two columns that cross, forming a compact 16-card park. Card placements can contribute to multiple scoring lines at once, so positioning is everything.</p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Shuffle a standard 52-card deck.</li>
            <li>Set aside four cards face up; these stay visible but unused.</li>
            <li>Randomly choose a first player.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>The game is played over 8 rounds. Each round, six cards are revealed and drafted in snake order:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Deal six cards face up.</li>
            <li>Players draft two cards per round, in snake order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 3 → 2 → 1.</li>
            <li>Place each card adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to at least one existing card; cards cannot be moved later.</li>
            <li>Your final layout must form two rows and two columns, for 16 total cards. Both rows must intersect both columns.</li>
            <li>Rotate first player clockwise each round.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Layouts</h3>
          <p>Parks can take many different forms; the only requirements are that all four paths must have five cards, and each row intersects with each column.</p>

Some of the many reasonable lattices          X
          </pre>

          <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <p>Players compare paths/hands head to head; comparing top rows, bottom rows, left columns, right columns. For each corresponding line, compare hands using standard poker rankings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The player with the best hand scores 1 point.</li>
            <li>If two tie for best, both score 1.</li>
            <li>If all three tie, no points are awarded.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The player with the most points out of 4 wins. If still tied, the single strongest hand anywhere in their park breaks the tie.</p>
