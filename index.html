          <h2>Poker Farm — Solo Variant</h2>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>In <strong>Poker Farm</strong>, you work the fields alone, building a 5×5 grid of cards by carefully drafting pairs from a rotating supply. Each card shapes multiple poker hands at once — rows, columns, and diagonals — and your challenge is to plant wisely, anticipating how each new card will strengthen or weaken your future harvest.</p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Shuffle a standard 52-card deck.</li>
            <li>Reveal two cards face up beside the deck. These are discarded for the game but remain visible.</li>
            <li>Leave space in front of you for your 5×5 grid and a face-up discard pile.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>The game proceeds over 25 placements, with each round following this pattern:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Reveal three cards face up from the deck.</li>
            <li>Discard the top card of the deck face up into a shared discard pile.</li>
            <li>Choose two of the three revealed cards to place into your grid.</li>
            <li>Discard the unchosen card face up beside the deck.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Continue this process until only two cards remain in the deck. Reveal both, choose one as your final (25th) placement, and discard the other.</p>

          <h3>Building Your Grid</h3>
          <p>Each new card must be placed adjacent (orthogonally or diagonally) to an existing card. Once placed, cards may not be moved. Your final layout must form a complete 5×5 grid. The tension comes from balancing strong individual lines against overall grid structure.</p>

          <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <p>When your farm is full, score each of your twelve poker lines: five rows, five columns, and two diagonals. Use the scoring table below to determine the value of each hand, then total your points to measure your harvest’s quality.</p>
          <table>
            <tr><th>Points</th><th>Hand</th></tr>
            <tr><td>55</td><td>Royal Flush</td></tr>
            <tr><td>34</td><td>Straight Flush</td></tr>
            <tr><td>21</td><td>Four of a Kind</td></tr>
            <tr><td>13</td><td>Full House</td></tr>
            <tr><td>8</td><td>Flush</td></tr>
            <tr><td>5</td><td>Straight</td></tr>
            <tr><td>3</td><td>Three of a Kind</td></tr>
            <tr><td>2</td><td>Two Pair</td></tr>
            <tr><td>1</td><td>One Pair</td></tr>
            <tr><td>0</td><td>High Card</td></tr>
          </table>
          <p>The theoretical maximum score is 359 points — an unlikely but satisfying harvest. Keep your best score and try to beat it in future games.</p>

          <h2>Poker Town — Two Player Game</h2>
          <p><strong>Poker Town</strong> is a tactical game of drafting and intersecting poker hands for two players. Each player builds their own 5×5 “town” of overlapping poker lines, placing cards that strengthen several streets at once. When the final card is placed, players compare their completed towns head-to-head to determine who becomes the mayor of Poker Town.</p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Shuffle the 52-card deck.</li>
            <li>Reveal two cards face up beside the deck; these stay visible but unused.</li>
            <li>Randomly choose a first player.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>The game is played over 13 rounds. Each round consists of drafting and placement:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Deal four cards face up. (If fewer than four remain, deal what’s left — this happens only in the final round.)</li>
            <li>Players draft in snake order: the first player takes one, the second takes two, and the first takes the last.</li>
            <li>Each drafted card must be placed immediately into your layout, adjacent to at least one existing card. Cards cannot be moved later.</li>
            <li>After each round, switch who drafts first.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>After 13 rounds (the final round having only two cards), both players will have completed 5×5 grids (25 cards each).</p>

          <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <p>Each player’s grid contains twelve poker lines — five rows, five columns, and two diagonals (NW–SE and SW–NE). For each corresponding line, compare hands using standard poker rankings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Royal Flush</li>
            <li>Straight Flush</li>
            <li>Four of a Kind</li>
            <li>Full House</li>
            <li>Flush</li>
            <li>Straight</li>
            <li>Three of a Kind</li>
            <li>Two Pair</li>
            <li>One Pair</li>
            <li>High Card</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The stronger hand earns one point for that line; ties score nothing. The player with the most points out of 12 wins. If still tied, the player with the single strongest hand anywhere in their grid wins.</p>

          <h2>Poker Park — Three Player Game</h2>
          <p><strong>Poker Park</strong> is a three-player variant where each player builds a lattice of intersecting streets and paths — two rows and two columns that cross, forming a compact 16-card park. Every placement contributes to multiple scoring lines at once, so positioning is everything.</p>

          <h3>Setup</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Shuffle the deck.</li>
            <li>Reveal four cards face up beside the deck; these are unused.</li>
            <li>Randomly choose a first player.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Gameplay</h3>
          <p>The game is played over 8 rounds. Each round, six cards are revealed and drafted in snake order:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Deal six cards face up.</li>
            <li>Player order: 1 → 2 → 3 → 3 → 2 → 1. Each player drafts two cards per round.</li>
            <li>Place each card adjacent to at least one existing card; cards cannot be moved later.</li>
            <li>Your final layout must form two crossing rows and two crossing columns, for 16 total cards.</li>
            <li>Rotate first player clockwise each round.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Scoring</h3>
          <p>Each player scores their four poker lines — two rows and two columns. For each line, all players compare hands:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Best hand scores 1 point.</li>
            <li>If two tie for best, both score 1.</li>
            <li>If all three tie, no points are awarded.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The player with the most points out of 4 wins. If still tied, the single strongest hand anywhere in their park breaks the tie.</p>
